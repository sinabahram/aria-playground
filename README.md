# aria-playground
A place to test new aria attributes, proposed authoring practices, and more with various prototypes of AT tools before proposing for standards.

## Examples
*Braille Input: This demonstrates the ability to have web developers receive raw Braille input without translation by the AT.
*Custom Braille Output: This demonstrates the ability to have different output for Braille than for speech.
*Math in Live Regions: This demonstrates putting MathML in a live region and having it read correctly as mathematics when updated.
