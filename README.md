# aria-playground
A place to test new aria attributes, proposed authoring practices, and more with various prototypes of AT tools before proposing for standards.

## Examples
* [Braille Input](https://sinabahram.github.io/aria-playground/BrailleInput.html): This demonstrates the ability to have web developers receive raw Braille input without translation by the AT.
* [Custom Braille Output](https://sinabahram.github.io/aria-playground/CustomBrailleOutput.html): This demonstrates the ability to have different output for Braille than for speech.
* [Math in Live Regions](https://sinabahram.github.io/aria-playground/MathInLiveRegions.html): This demonstrates putting MathML in a live region and having it read correctly as mathematics when updated.
